Write a program that prints the average population size of Cantonal
capitals of Switzerland.

The average is defined as sum of the population of all cities
(glarus + chur + ...) divided by the number of cities.


Use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cantonal_capitals_of_Switzerland
as the starting point.

Save the population for each city in a variable (i.e. glarus=12446).

Also save the average in a variable.

Use the variable to print the average.

There should be roughly 26 capitals in your code.

Hint: Solving http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex4.html before
