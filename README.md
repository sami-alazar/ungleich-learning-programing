## avg-capitals.py

Write a program that prints the average population size of Cantonal
capitals of Switzerland.

The average is defined as sum of the population of all cities
(glarus + chur + ...) divided by the number of cities.

Use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cantonal_capitals_of_Switzerland
as the starting point.

Save the population for each city in a variable (i.e. glarus=12446).

Also save the average in a variable.

Use the variable to print the average.

There should be roughly 26 capitals in your code.

## time-to-glarus.py

Imagine you travel from Basel to Hemmiken and many other locations and
finally you arrive in Schwanden. Create a python program that prints
the total sum of the travelling time required, if you travel via the
following locations:

 * Hannover
 * Basel
 * Hemmiken
 * Gossau ZH
 * Turbenthal
 * Zollikerberg
 * Uster
 * Zürich Wollishofen
 * Luchsingen
 * Schwanden

Also print the time it needs for every additional step.

Output should be similar to this:

  Hannover to Basel: x minutes
  Travelling to Hemmiken: y minutes
  ...
  Travelling all the way to Schwanden: z minutes

Hint:

You can find the travelling time by train on http://www.sbb.ch/.

## everywhere-to-glarus.py

Imagine you want to travel from Zürich or other places Glarus.
Save the time from the following locations in a variable, print the
time required for every location and print the average time required.

Locations:

 * Zürich HB
 * Chur
 * Geneva
 * Bern
 * Winterthur
 * Aarau
 * Zug
 * Luzern
 * Bellinzona
 * Schaffhausen
 * Olten

Hint:

You can find the travelling time by train on http://www.sbb.ch/.


## smart-avg-capitals.py

Recapitulate what you have done in "avg-capitals.py" above. Now
instead of using single variables, use a dictionary.
